# My First Repository

Welcome to my first repository! Here, I'll be coding primarily in **C#** and **HTML** as I build up my skills and work on various projects.

## About This Repository

This repository will serve as a learning playground where I experiment with different coding techniques and put theory into practice. I'll focus on coding fundamentals in **C#**, designing webpages with **HTML**, and learning best practices for version control with **Git**.

## Future Projects

Some project ideas I am interested in exploring:

- **Web Application Development:** Building a small-scale web app with an HTML frontend and a C# backend for user management or data handling.
- **Console Applications in C#:** Working on a simple game, calculator, or text-based application to strengthen my understanding of C#.
- **Portfolio Website:** Creating a personal portfolio website using HTML to showcase my projects and track my coding journey.

Thank you for checking out my repository!
